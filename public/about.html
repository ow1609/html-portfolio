<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/OW Profile Pic.jpeg" height="200"/>
<p>I have always been an avid user of technology - several devices and cloud services practically run my everyday life.
  I studied Spanish and French at Exeter University so I'm big into learning languages. Just over a year ago,
  a friend showed me this particular language called "JavaScript" and together, we pair programmed to test
  drive a simple FizzBuzz program. I was simply hooked on coding from that moment onwards.</p>

<p>I have completed various tutorials and courses to be able to produce websites like this one, 
  built entirely with HTML 5. I look forward to the next stage where I will learn to style
  websites using CSS and add functionality with JavaScript and React. For now, please enjoy
  this retro-style portfolio website, consisting of some HTML projects I have built.</p>
