    <h1>Onuora's Favourite Movies</h1>
    <h2>My Top Movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
    <p>This is a film that I have watched countless times and stars one of my all time favourite actors - 
        the late, great Patrick Swayze.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film is about a young girl who is on vacation with her wealthy family who falls in love with
        one of the entertainment staff at the holiday resort. This is a story of people falling in love
        from different backgrounds with a feast for the eyes from the dancing scenes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Look out for the water lift scene - a truly iconic moment.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iconic movie line(s): "I carried a watermelon," and "Nobody puts Baby in the corner."</p>
    <br />
    <h3>The Fugitive</h3>
    <p>Another classic film, without any fancy CGI or visual effects.
        Simply first class acting and an excellent plotline and script. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Harrison Ford plays a man who is wrongly accused of his wife's murder and sentenced to prison.
        He goes on a quest to venge her death and vindicate himself of the crime. Tommy Lee Jones plays
        a tireless detective, determined to catch the fugitive.
        <br />
        <br />
        Look out for my favourite scene in the water damn when Ford insists, "I didn't kill my wife!"
        to which, Jones retorts, "I don't care."
        <br />
        <br />
        A truly epic tale of a man's quest for justice and vindication.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Mulan</h3>
    <p>Of course, I wouldn't be a millenial if I didn't have a Disney film among my favourite movies of all time. 
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a tale of a daughter's love for her father. When her frail and elderly father is conscripted into
        the army and ordered to fight at war, Mulan disguises herself, posing as his son instead of his
        daughter, in order to join the army and fight in his place. In the movie's era, women were not permitted to join the
        army as soldiers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mulan was one of my all time favourite heroes growing up. She
        is a strong female willing to risk her life to save her father's. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Mulan's funny "pet" dragon and cute cricket helper make this film a family favourite.
        <br />
        <br />
        The music score of this film is also great with some
        really catchy songs to sing along to!</p>
